## Inspiration
This project is inspired by the 17 sustainable development goals from the United Nations. InvaScan aligns specifically with Goal #15 Life on Land.

## What it does
By taking a picture of the plant, InvaScan will provide information about the plant and determine if it is an invasive species. If yes, it will also provide contact details for the local organization responsible for managing such species.

## How we built it
JavaScript and React are used to complete the project implementation. Git is used for team collaboration.

## Challenges we ran into
There are three people in our group who have never used JavaScript and React before. It took us a lot of time to learn JavaScript from zero and understand the React framework for writing the UI. Another issue is that our webcam often encounters unrecognized bugs, and we have been stuck for a long time. Finally, the API use of the plant Encyclopedia left us somewhat confused, since that company did not have a corresponding lib for direct call.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We're thrilled to have successfully completed our first team project in the Hackathon. But what we are even more proud of is that we can use our knowledge to make a meaningful contribution to the sustainable development of the Earth.

## What we learned
We have been playing with some JavaScript and React. This is the first time we gained knowledge of front-end development. We also learned some groupwork techniques. When searching for information, we realized how harmful invasive species can be to the environment.

## What's next for InvaScan
The next step for InvaScan can be to add animal recognition functionality or optimize the UI to make it look better.
